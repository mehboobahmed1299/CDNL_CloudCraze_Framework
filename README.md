
# Test Automation Framework (Java | Selenium | TestNG)

This project is a Data-Driven Test Automation Framework built with Java 11, Selenium WebDriver, and TestNG.
It is designed to perform UI test automation efficiently with reusable components, headless browser execution, and cross-browser testing via LambdaTest Cloud Grid.
The framework also generates detailed HTML reports using Extent Reports and captures runtime logs using Log4j.
